    subtitle: "National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) - Operational Field Guide",
    domain: "Statistical Competencies",
    sourceDoc: "MoSPI NSSO/SDRD Technical Report No. 589",
    wordCount: 840,
    excerpt: `1. Sample Design for Socio-Economic Surveys:
A stratified multi-stage design is adopted for the 79th round survey. The First Stage Units (FSU) are the 2011 Census villages in the rural sector and Urban Frame Survey (UFS) blocks in the urban sector. The Ultimate Stage Units (USU) are households in both sectors.
2. Stratification:
Each district of a State/UT is taken as a basic stratum. In rural sector, if 'r' is the number of FSUs allocated to a district, the district is divided into r/2 sub-strata if r > 8. In the urban sector, UFS blocks are stratified into two sub-strata based on affluent pockets (sub-stratum 1) and remaining blocks (sub-stratum 2).
3. Selection of FSUs:
In the rural sector, FSUs are selected by Probability Proportional to Size with Replacement (PPSWR), size being the census population of the village. In the urban sector, FSUs are selected using Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR).
4. Sub-division and Hamlet-group / Sub-block Formation:
For large villages/blocks with population exceeding 1200, the FSU is divided into two or more hamlet-groups (rural) or sub-blocks (urban) of approximately equal population, and two hamlet-groups/sub-blocks are selected with equal probability for listing.
5. Estimation Procedure & Multipliers:
The unbiased estimate of total Y for stratum s is calculated using the inverse probability sampling weight (multiplier):
W_i = (Total FSUs in Stratum / Allocated FSUs) * (Census Size / Village Size) * (Listed Households / Sampled Households).`

    subtitle: "Price Statistics Division (PSD) - Technical Manual 2024",
    domain: "Statistical Competencies",
    sourceDoc: "MoSPI Price Statistics Division Guideline Vol. IV",
    wordCount: 760,
    excerpt: `1. Scope and Objective:
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that a reference population acquires, uses or pays for consumption. In India, NSO compiles CPI on base 2012=100 separately for Rural, Urban and Combined sectors.
2. Weighting Diagram:
The weighting diagrams for CPI are derived from the results of the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES). The consumption basket is classified into 6 major groups: (i) Food and Beverages (45.86% weight in Combined), (ii) Pan, tobacco and intoxicants, (iii) Clothing and footwear, (iv) Housing (urban only), (v) Fuel and light, and (vi) Miscellaneous.
3. Pricing Mechanism:
Prices are collected weekly from selected 1,181 village markets across the country for rural CPI, and monthly from 1,114 quotations across 310 towns for urban CPI through a dedicated mobile application (CAPI).
4. Index Formula:
The modified Laspeyres formula is used for calculating sub-group, group, and overall general indices:
I_t = Sum [ (P_it / P_i0) * W_i ] / Sum(W_i) * 100
Where P_it is price of item i in current period, P_i0 is base price, and W_i is base-year expenditure weight.
5. Imputation for Non-Availability:
If an item price is missing due to seasonal non-availability or temporary stockout, geometric mean price relative of available varieties or higher sub-group trend is used to impute the price.`

    excerpt: `1. Adoption of SNA 2008 in India:
With the base revision to 2011-12, the National Accounts Division adopted the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). Key changes include the presentation of Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices instead of GDP at factor cost as the headline measure of production.
2. Relationship between GVA and GDP:
- GVA at Basic Prices = Output at basic prices - Intermediate Consumption at purchasers' prices.
- GDP at Market Prices = GVA at Basic Prices + Product Taxes (Central GST, State GST, Customs, Excise) - Product Subsidies (Food, Fertilizer, Fuel).
3. Treatment of MCA21 Database:
For the organized private corporate sector in manufacturing and services, the production approach utilizes electronic financial filing data from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA21 database), analyzing balance sheets and Profit & Loss accounts of over 500,000 active enterprises.
4. Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM):
FISIM represents the value of financial services provided by banks that are not directly charged as fees. It is calculated as the difference between interest received on loans minus reference rate interest, plus reference rate interest minus interest paid on deposits.
5. Capital Formation & Intellectual Property Products (IPP):
Under SNA 2008, Research and Development (R&D) expenditures and software expenditures are treated as Gross Fixed Capital Formation rather than intermediate consumption.`

    excerpt: `1. Transition from Legacy SPSS/Stata to Open Source Data Science:
To accommodate massive microdata datasets like the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), MoSPI is deploying Python (Polars/Pandas) and R on secure government cloud infrastructure (MeghRaj).
2. Automated Validation and Scrutiny:
Using vectorized operations in Python, automated scrutiny routines flag data entry errors, invalid occupation codes (NCO-2015), and extreme outlier expenditures in seconds:
\`\`\`python
# Vectorized range check example
invalid_records = df.filter(
    (pl.col('weekly_hours_worked') > 168) | 
    (pl.col('daily_wage') < 0)
)
\`\`\`
3. Web Scraping for High-Frequency Price Monitoring:
NSSTA training focuses on utilizing BeautifulSoup and Selenium to harvest daily vegetable, fuel, and cereal prices from open mandi portals and e-commerce websites.
4. Machine Learning for Predictive Imputation:
Random Forest regressors and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) are evaluated to impute missing revenue figures in small-scale enterprise surveys, outperforming traditional mean imputation by preserving covariance structures.`

    wordCount: 720,
    excerpt: `1. Application to Government Statistical Surveys:
The DPDP Act 2023 regulates the processing of digital personal data. While official statistical operations conducted under the Collection of Statistics Act 2008 benefit from research and statutory exemptions, strict data governance is mandated.
2. Anonymization and De-identification:
Datasets released for public research via the National Data & Analytics Platform (NDAP) must be fully anonymized. Direct identifiers (names, Aadhaar numbers, exact GPS coordinates of households) must be permanently purged or perturbed using pseudo-random hashing and cell suppression.
3. Data Fiduciary Responsibilities:
MoSPI and designated State Directorates act as Data Fiduciaries. Reasonable security safeguards must be maintained to prevent data leaks. All survey data collected on tablets (CAPI) must be encrypted using AES-256 both in transit and at rest.
4. Retention Limitation:
Field raw audio recordings or identifiable enumerator logs must not be retained beyond the period strictly necessary for quality verification audits.`
